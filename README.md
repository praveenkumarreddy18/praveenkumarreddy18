## **Enthusiastic Java Developer** | **Lifelong Learner** | **Open-Source Contributor**

### About Me
I'm a passionate Java developer with a strong interest in building scalable and 
efficient backend systems. Since graduating with a degree in Computer Science, 
I have been honing my skills in Java development, focusing on technologies like 
**Spring Boot**, **Hibernate**, and **RESTful API** development. I love solving real-world problems through code and I'm
constantly improving by working on new projects, exploring the latest tools, and 
contributing to open-source communities.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Advanced **Java Streams**, **Microservices architecture**, and **AWS Cloud**.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Open-source Java projects and new technologies like **Kubernetes**.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Java, Spring Boot, REST APIs, and Backend Development.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of solving algorithmic challenges during my free time!

### Highlighted Project
1. **[Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning](https://github.com/praveenkumarreddy18/leaf-disease-detection)**  
   *Technologies*: Python, Keras, MySQL  
   Leaf disease detection using deep learning leverages convolutional 
   neural networks to analyze plant leaf images, identifying diseases early and 
   accurately. This technology aids farmers in taking timely actions, 
   improving crop yield and reducing pesticide use for sustainable agriculture.
